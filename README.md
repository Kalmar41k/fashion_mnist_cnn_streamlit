# Fashion MNIST Classification with CNN and VGG16
This project focuses on building and comparing two deep learning models for image classification using the Fashion MNIST dataset. Additionally, a Streamlit-based web interface is provided for real-time image prediction.

# Overview

## Model Development:
- A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained from scratch to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset.
- A pre-trained VGG16 model was fine-tuned and adapted for the same classification task.
- The performance of both models was compared to evaluate their accuracy and generalization.

## Web Application:
- A user-friendly web interface was developed using the Streamlit framework.
- The application allows users to upload an image file and receive predictions from both the CNN and VGG16 models.

## Features:
- Model Comparison: Analyze the performance of a custom CNN versus a fine-tuned VGG16 model.
- Interactive Web App: Easily test the models using the Streamlit interface.
- File Upload Functionality: Upload custom images to receive predictions in real time.
